Notmuch Addressbook manager for vim
===================================

DEPENDENCES
-----------

* notmuch with python or python3 bindings

INSTALL
-------

* Standalone install

if you do not want to use the vim script file, you can install the module as
follows:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

or using:

```sh
pip install notmuch_abook
```

* Vimscript install

Use vundle to install this script, add to your vimrc:

```vim
Bundle "guyzmo/notmuch-abook"
```

for convenience, you can create a symlink to your bin directory:

```sh
ln -s $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pythonx/notmuch_abook.py ~/bin/notmuch-abook
```

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Open notmuch configuration file (usually $HOME/.notmuch-config) and add:

```ini
[addressbook]
path=/home/USER/.notmuch-abook.db
backend=sqlite3
```

where USER is your username (or at any other place).

The default notmuch query string is:

```
NOT tag:junk AND NOT folder:drafts AND NOT tag:deleted
```

If you prefer something else, you can specify it in notmuch configuration file:

```ini
[addressbook]
path=/home/USER/.notmuch-abook.db
backend=sqlite3
query=folder:Inbox OR folder:Sent
```

If you use a non-default notmuch configuration file, you should set the
NOTMUCH_CONFIG environment variable (see notmuch man page).  This can even be
done inside the vimrc file, with:

```vim
let $NOTMUCH_CONFIG = expand("~/.notmuch-config-custom")
```

In your favorite mail filter program, add a rule such as (for procmail), so all
new mail will be parsed:

```
:0 Wh
| python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pythonx/notmuch_abook.py update
```

If you can't use procmail (eg if you are using offlineimap) then you could put
the following few lines at the start of the [post-new
hook](http://notmuchmail.org/manpages/notmuch-hooks-5/) (**before** you remove
the new tag).  Also note this is shell syntax, so you'll have to adapt if your
hook is in another language.

```sh
# first update notmuch-abook
for file in $(notmuch search --output=files tag:new) ; do
    cat "$file" | $HOME/bin/notmuch-abook update
done
```

USAGE
-----

For the first time, you shall launch the script as follows to create the
addresses database (it takes ~20 seconds for 10000 mails):

```sh
python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pythonx/notmuch_abook.py create
```

and then, to lookup an address, either you use the vimscript to complete
(`<c-x><c-u>`) the name in a header field, or you can call it from commandline:

```sh
python $HOME/.vim/bundle/notmuch-abook/pythonx/notmuch_abook.py lookup Guyz
```

the script will match any word beginning with the pattern in the name and
address parts of the entry.
